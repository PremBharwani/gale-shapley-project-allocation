## Use-cases
This repository can be used for the problems pertaining to allocation problems, specifically which involve preference ordering(read [stable matching problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_marriage_problem) from both parties. The algorithm employed is a tailored version of [Gale-Shapley algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gale%E2%80%93Shapley_algorithm) to cater many-one matchings. 

The common use-cases for these could be for *Project allocation to students, Courses allocation, team formations, etc.*

> This was used to allocate projects to the students during the summer'22 for the projects offered by [Science and Technology Council](https://sntiitk.in/), [IIT Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/).

## Running
**Before running please read through the [instructions](INSTRUCTIONS.md)!**
```bash
python allot.py
```
* `allot.py` is the only file you need to run. All the other files are utilities. <br>
It produces two important files, one which contains *(Roll Number, Project Alloted)* pairs, and one which contains fraudulent pairs, which may arise from a student being allotted a project which was not in his preferences or if a student had not filled the preference form altogether. The other files are common statistics regarding the allocation.
* `config.py` has some parameters-
    * Number of preferences a student is allowed to fill
    * The path to `master_responses`
* Dependencies: `pandas`

## Common debugging:
* `Duplicate Roll Number found...`: There is a duplicate entry (of a roll number) in `master_responses`. Some suggestions-
    * Keep the form editable to ensure that the same person does not fill the form twice
    * It might be the case that someone made a typo while filling the form. Take suitable actions
* Check the project names, most probably there is an inconsistency
* A student/project not getting an allotment is completely possible and is not erroneous. No bugs here, only functionalities
